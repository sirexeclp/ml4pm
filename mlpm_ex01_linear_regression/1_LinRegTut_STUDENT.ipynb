    "# Intro  \n",
    "Welcome to your first programming exercise of this course. We will investigate a diabetes-dataset and see if certain variables are associated with each other. In this tutorial, we want to test for true associations with linear regression.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the causal connections between two variables, $x$ and $y$, their true relationship may be linear or nonlinear. However, regardless of the true pattern of association, a linear model can always serve as a first approximation. In this case, the analysis is particularly simple,  \n",
    "$$y = \\alpha + \\beta x + e$$ \n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is the y-intercept, $\\beta$ is the slope of the line (also known as the regression\n",
    "coefficient), and e is the residual error. Letting  \n",
    "$$\\hat y = \\alpha + \\beta x$$\n",
    "be the value of $y$ predicted by the model, then the residual error is the deviation between the observed and predicted y value, i.e., $e =  y - \\hat y$. When information on $x$ is used to predict $y$, $x$ is referred to as the predictor or independent variable and $y$ as the response or dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of linear regression analysis is to estimate the model parameters, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, that give the “best fit” for the joint distribution of $x$ and $y$. The true parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are only obtainable if the entire population is sampled. With an incomplete sample, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are approximated by sample estimators, denoted as $a$ and $b$. In real-world applications, there is often only a weak linear relationship between two variables which makes it difficult to say anything more precise. In order to infer the parameters of our model, an objective definition of “best fit” is required. The mathematical method of least-squares linear regression provides one such best-fit solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise you will need the pandas, matplotlib and numpy python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide template code, which you will have to complete. The parts you will have to change are marked with `#your_code`\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideas conveyed in this exercise, especially the connection between the covariance of two variables $Cov(x,y)$ and the regression coefficient $b$ are explained in more detail [here](http://nitro.biosci.arizona.edu/courses/EEB581-2006/handouts/bivdistrib.pdf)."
